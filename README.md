## About

To play go to: [twosails](https://twosails.github.io/tic-tac-toe/www/dist/)

This is a static built tic-tac-toe game. Made to practise writing Rust and WASM Code.

Uses a basic implementation of a Minimax algorithm to play as an opponent

Future additions to this project include optimisations to reduce the time taken to `find_best_move`, currently taken on average ~120ms.
